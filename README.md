# Expression Parser
Im gonna try to make this quick.

Im sick and tiered of having to make simple conversions of sizes and having to solve equasions. This can all be done through a CLI.

Ive written a repo that parsers strings into expressions and solves them / calculates with them. I want something like that, but better

## Vision
Expression evaluator from strings with:
- orders-of-magnitude.
- assigments
- parameters
- solver
